# POWER PONG

## About the Game
The purpose of this project is to reboot the classic game pong. With the aim of retaining the key elements of the original game while bringing it to the 21st century. The game also needs to be developed in 3D and have some form of progression. 

This game, Power Pong, will revolve around a first to three, round rule system and play similarly to classic Pong, with a twist. This twist will be the inclusion of various abilities the player can use to beat their opponent. The game will reward the player with points for simply playing the game. These points can be used to acquire and upgrade these abilities between rounds.
